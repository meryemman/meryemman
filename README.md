### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub. My name is [Meryem Manessouri](https://meryemman.github.io/) and I'm a Data Scientist and Ph.D. student at [Mohemmadia Engineering School](https://www.emi.ac.ma/) (EMI), Rabat - Morocco, under the supervision of Prof. XX. Before that, I obtained my Master degree at [Sidi Mohamed ben Abdellah University](http://www.usmba.ac.ma/) (USMBA) [Faculty of Sciences Dhar El Mahraz](http://www.fsdmfes.ac.ma/) (FSDM), Fez - Morocco. My major research interest lies in the intersection of Data Sciences and Natural Language Processing, as well as Computer Vision.
